# React & Redux
A repository to store every file that i'll be creating along the React &amp; Redux course from The Net Ninja.

There is two simple applications so far:
- todoapp (A todo list we've made to understand react components structure.)

- poketimes (Single page application we've made to understand how 'react-router-dom' works.)

To test these applications, open the directory of any of them in bash and run:

<code>npm install && npm start</code>
